    <h2> Step1</h2>
    <p>Place your right foot behind your left foot and raise your right foot up on your right toes so that both feet form to “L” shape.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Slide your left foot to the back, and slowly slide upward using your left toe. That means, slide your left foot back and step on it with your left toes.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>At the same time, the right foot is placed flat again on the sole. This will cause both feet to take on an “L” shape again.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Cross your feet again in the same way. Just repeat these actions.</p>
    <p> After you practiced a lot, finally you can do it smoothly.</p> 
    <h2> More tips</h2>
    <p> Take a rhydm and Swing your arm slowly during while moonwalking.</p>
    
    <h2>How can I know I'm mastered at this?</h2>
<p> If you want to know that you are doing well, then try it on the floor and check you smoothed it out! If not, maybe you should practice more.</p>
