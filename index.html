    <h1>How to Moonwalk like Michael Jackson</h1>
    <p>In this page, I will tell you guys how to Moonwalk. </p>
    <h3> Why I madethis page.</h3>
    <p> I'm making this page because if you know this skill, you can show off this skill infront of people and become famous(maybe). However, take a risk that your socks and shoes can wear out!
    <p>Here are the metarials for moonwalk. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slippery floor(If you mastered at moonwalk, then you can try on the tough floor)</li>
      <li>M.J shoes(for outsise) or socks(for home)</li>
      <li>If you have, M.J hat and suit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are the steps</p>
    <h2> Step1</h2>
    <p>Place your right foot behind your left foot and raise your right foot up on your right toes so that both feet form to “L” shape.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Slide your left foot to the back, and slowly slide upward using your left toe. That means, slide your left foot back and step on it with your left toes.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>At the same time, the right foot is placed flat again on the sole. This will cause both feet to take on an “L” shape again.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Cross your feet again in the same way. Just repeat these actions.</p>
    <p> After you practiced a lot, finally you can do it smoothly.</p> 
    <h2> More tips</h2>
    <p> Take a rhydm and Swing your arm slowly during while moonwalking.</p>
    <h2>How can I know  I'm mastered at this?</h2>
<p>After you understand these steps perfectly, try it on the floor. And if you followed steps well, then it means you mastered it. After you mastered it, try more faster!</p>
